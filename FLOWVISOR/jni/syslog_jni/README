A really simple wrapper around openlog(3) and syslog(3), because:

1) syslog is really useful and admin friendly
2) java does not implement syslog in it's native libraries
    (because it's non-portable)
3) java does not support unix sockets by default (!!)
    so, I can't write this natively in java for linkx
4) all of the 3rd party stuff I've found doesn't work 
    on linux unless the admin enables INET sockets for
    syslog, which I think they are unlikely to do

COMPILING:

builds cleanly under linux, but other OS's will need different compile and linking options.  As a temporary work around, you can define you own CFLAGS and LDFLAGS on the command line, e.g., 

make CFLAGS="-I/path/to/java/include -g" LDFLAGS="-g"


TODO: 
    move to configure/libtool if people are going to use this on non-linux systems
