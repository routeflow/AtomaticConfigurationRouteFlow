This directory contains the data necessary to run the CLI unit tests.

If you make changes to support new tests, please keep in mind that you need to
regenerate ALL the data impacted - not just the one thing you're trying to test.
For example, if you edit the flowspace for the "bob" slice, you will need to
regenerate the following files:

flowspace-all.txt
flowspace-bob.txt
flowspace-bob-ids.txt
