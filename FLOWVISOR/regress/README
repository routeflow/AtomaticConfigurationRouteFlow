Using FlowVisor's Test Suite:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlowVisor ships with its own regression test suite:

To us it, run `./tests.sh` out of this directory after you've built
	the FlowVisor.   IF you run ./tests.sh with an extra arg, it will
	pause after the FlowVisor starts, but before the tests start.
	This is very useful when you would like to run flowvisor through
    the debugger

NOTES:
1) The above script runs all tests.  Individual tests can be run as
	`./tests-$type.py`
2) By default, each test starts up it's own flowvisor instance.  Each
    test can take a port as an optional parameter to use an already 
    running FlowVisor, i.e., for debugging
    ./tests-base.py 6633
3) By default, FlowVisor starts up on port 16633 and API server on 18080
4) FlowVisor by defaults zeros pad varriables where nox does not,
    so this can cause issues with exact string matches
