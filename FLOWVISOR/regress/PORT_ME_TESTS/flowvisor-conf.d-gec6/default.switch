# This is the config file for switches
# that we don't explicitly config somewhere else
# i.e., it is the "default" switch config

# Name: is optional -- defaults to filename

# this is the template for all switches we don't know anything about
Default: 1
# This "ID" is where default switches start getting their IDs from
# i.e., the first default switch will be ID=9999+1, the 2nd, ID=9999+2
# etc...
ID: 9999
